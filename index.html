         <h3>About Me</h3>
         <img src="images/picture-profile-fixed.jpg" alt="Alma" width="200">
         <p>Hi! My name is Alma. I am currently a BYU-Pathway student, working
            toward
            becoming a Software Developer within the next two years. I really
            love coding
            and feel grateful for the opportunity to pursue this education.
            When I’m not at the computer studying, I’m usually at my sewing
            machine. I’m
            pretty tall, so I make most of my own clothes, this is a skill I’ve
            enjoyed
            since I was a
            teenager. I also love cleaning my home, cooking for my family (and
            sharing
            with
            others), planting medicinal herbs, and playing with my two dogs.
            I’m a mom, a sister, and a friend. English is my second language,
            and
            I’m fluent in Spanish. I earned a BA in Engineering from a foreign
            university
            and worked for many years as an HR and Safety Coordinator in a
            construction
            company. Later, I changed paths and completed a Web Developer
            Certificate
            through a bootcamp.
            I would describe myself as a happy, lifelong learner.

         <h3>Sonora, Mexico</h3>
         <img src="images/carne-asada-beef-Fixed.jpg" alt="carne asada">
         <p>Sonora is Mexico's second-largest state, located in the northwest,
            known for its mineral wealth (especially copper), agricultural
            output,
            and a significant livestock and ranching tradition, including famous
            regional foods like carne asada. The state features diverse
            geography, from the arid Sonoran Desert and coastline along the Gulf
            of California to the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains in the east.
            Its history is marked by indigenous communities, Jesuit missions,
            and strong economic and
            cultural ties to the United States, particularly Arizona.</p>
